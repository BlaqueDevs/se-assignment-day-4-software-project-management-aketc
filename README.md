## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall relies on thorough front planning like when a Human Resource Manager has salary budget for the financial year and other igid requirement for a cerain period of time whereas the Agile model is more flexible as it takes these processes in repeating cycles 
The advantages of the Agile model include increased flexibility to adapt to changing requirements, improved customer satisfaction through frequent feedback loops, enhanced team collaboration, faster time to market, and continuous improvement; however, disadvantages can include difficulty in managing complex projects, potential lack of detailed documentation, challenges in accurately predicting project outcomes, and heavy reliance on customer engagement for successful implementation. 
The waterfall model's main advantage is its structured and predictable approach, making it easy to manage and document with clear phases, while its primary disadvantage is its inflexibility, making it difficult to accommodate changes in requirements once development is underway, potentially leading to delays and higher costs if issues are discovered late in the process

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is ideal for dynamic environments and continuous improvement initiatives, while Waterfall is preferable for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines.
For agile, if your project has dynamic requirements, needs frequent client feedback, and values adaptability like Safaricom USSD codes
For waterfall, Constructing a building


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Unit Testing. 
Integration Testing. 
System Testing
Acceptance Testing
Maintaining high standards is crucial because it leads to a reliable, user-friendly product, reduces maintenance costs, improves customer satisfaction, and enhances the overall reputation of the company. 

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Provides a roadmap that managers can use to assign tasks, schedule work and budget appropriately. Helps focus team members on common objectives. Prevents projects, particularly complex ones, from expanding beyond the established vision. 
WBS is a project management tool that breaks down a project into smaller, more manageable components, creating a hierarchical view of the entire project scope, which is useful for effectively planning, organizing, and tracking progress by clearly defining all tasks, deliverables, and dependencies within a project, allowing for better resource allocation, cost estimation, and overall project contro


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Creating a gantt chart provides a total overview of the project from start to finish, the members involved in each step, and all the tasks required to complete the project. Once your project's gantt chart is complete, you now have a grip on the project. You can see it and visualize the steps to completion
